Scripts for the "Ecological turnover of strain-level diversity in the honeybee gut microbiota between nurses and foragers" manuscript.
=======

This repository contains the necessary scripts and metadata required to reproduce the analyses and figures from the "Ecological turnover of strain-level diversity in the honeybee gut microbiota between nurses and foragers" manuscript. THey use metagenomic data from honeybee gut DNA sequencing with Illumina.

Most of the scripts and analyses from this manuscript have been adapted, developed or taken directly from the work of Kirsten Ellegaard, in particular the following publications:

Pre-requisites
----------

The scripts and analyses rely on a genomic database built by Kirsten Ellegaard ([zenodo_link](https://zenodo.org/record/4661061#.YGmkRy0RoRA)), which contains mostly genomes of bacteria previously isolated from guts of *Apis mellifera*, *Apis cerana* and bumble bee species.

In terms of software, the scripts require:

* Python 3 (version 3.6 or higher)
* Bash
* R  (version 4.2.1, including packages: "segmented", "plyr", "ape" (version 5.6-2), "data.table" (version 1.14.2), "qvalue" (version 2.28.0), "PERMANOVA" (version 0.2.0), "vegan" (2.6-2), "ggplot2" (version 3.3.6), "reshape" (version 0.8.9), "gridExtra" (version 2.3), "ggrepel" (version 0.9.1), "RColorBrewer" (version 1.1-3) and "scales" (version 1.2.1))
* [samtools](http://www.htslib.org) (version  1.15-8-gbdc5bb8, should be added to the path)
* [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) (for the mapping) (version 0.7.15-r1142-dirty, should be added to the path)
* [SPAdes] (https://github.com/ablab/spades) (for the assemblies) (version 3.10.1, should be added to the path)
* [freebayes] (https://github.com/freebayes/freebayes) (for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms) (version v1.3.1-19-g54bf409, should be added to the path)
* [fastQC] (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) (quality check of the input data) (should be added to the path)
* [Trimmomatic] (https://github.com/usadellab/Trimmomatic) (trimming of the reads and removal of the sequencing adapters) (version 0.35, should be added to the path)


Running the pipeline
